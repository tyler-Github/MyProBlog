**What is SEO?**

Search engine optimization, or SEO, is a set of techniques aimed at enhancing the look and positioning of web pages in natural search results. Since organic search is the most popular method for users to find and access online information, having a strong SEO strategy is crucial for increasing both the quality and volume of visitors to your website.


**Why is SEO important?**

Let's divide our concept into three components to better comprehend the benefits of SEO:

* The unpaid listings on a search engine results page (SERP) that the search engine has judged are most pertinent to the user's query are known as organic search results. Many SERPs contain a sizable amount of adverts, more specifically PPC or pay-per-click ads. In contrast to these adverts, organic search results are positioned according to the search engine's organic ranking algorithms rather than advertiser bids. You cannot purchase a higher position for your page in organic search results.

* The relevance of the visitor and their search query to the material on your website is a measure of the quality of organic traffic. You can get all the visitors you want, but if they arrive on your site believing you to be an Apple computer resource when in reality you are just a farmer selling apples, they're likely to leave without making a purchase. Only people who are genuinely interested in the goods, data, or other resources your site provides constitute high-quality traffic. The search engine's efforts to match a user's search intent to the web pages listed in the SERP are taken advantage of by high-quality SEO.

* The volume of individuals who arrive at your website through natural search results Because search results that are near the top of the SERP are far more likely to be clicked on by users, it's critical to employ your SEO strategy to rank relevant pages as highly as you can. You are more likely to notice an increase in worthwhile conversions the more highly-qualified visitors you draw to your website.
